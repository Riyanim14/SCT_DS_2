# 🧊 Titanic Survival Analysis – Task 2

> A simple yet insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset focusing on passenger survival outcomes using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the `gender_submission.csv` file from the famous Titanic Kaggle dataset. The focus is on:
- Understanding the distribution of survivors vs non-survivors
- Visualizing this data in a clean, informative way
- Enhancing visual presentation with Seaborn & Matplotlib styling
